# Project Purpose
PrizmJ was created, alongside a friend, to simulate movement through a burning building using a referenced [Dijkstra algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm). The project uses a very basic 3D environment for simulating any number of building fires. The buildings can be customized (only internally) and the system picks a room at random to begin "smoking." The system will then "search" for the best course of exit out of the building using the algorithm. 

# Project Author
My name is Tyler Crowe, I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I try to put aside time every week specifically for creating and I hope this GitHub profile will act as my portfolio when necessary. I’ve been programming for about 8 years now and have no plans on stopping now! If you’re more interested in me or my work, visit [my website](https://loneboat.com/).
